# GraphsInConsole
Fun little Win32 console application written in Data Structures class.

This small application creates a graph of certain size (first line of input) then proceeds to add edges based on 
input (structured on same line: x y). It then has BFS and DFS implemented and outputs these as parent arrays for each. 
This does not have a remove for either edges or vertices. NOTE: Graph is stored in an Adjacency Matrix.

This was written for a data structures course at university. Because of this there are instances where
I did things to class specs rather than I would have done them. Some class specs included limited libraries 
allowed to include and use, certain style when writing classes, and just overall structure. We were also to use unsigned char 
bytes as our columns and then perform bitwise operations on those.

## TODO
- I would like to go back through and comment a lot better. Maybe restructure it to better fit how I like it structured. 
- Add in more functionality to the graph itself such as: remove edges and vertices, find any nodes neighbors, and so on.
